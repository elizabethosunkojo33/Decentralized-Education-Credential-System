# Decentralized Education Credential System

A blockchain-based platform revolutionizing educational credentials through verifiable, portable, and self-sovereign digital certification.

## Overview

The Decentralized Education Credential System transforms how educational achievements are verified, issued, and managed throughout a learner's lifetime. By leveraging blockchain technology, our platform creates tamper-proof credentials that can be instantly verified by employers, institutions, and other stakeholders while giving learners complete ownership of their educational records.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Course Completion Verification Contract

This contract validates educational achievements by creating a secure, verifiable record of completed coursework.

- **Key Features**:
    - Transparent completion criteria definition
    - Automated verification of learning milestones
    - Multi-source validation (instructor, peer, automated assessment)
    - Partial completion recognition
    - Learning evidence storage and verification
    - Integration with learning management systems
    - Academic integrity protection

### Credential Issuance Contract

Manages the creation and distribution of tamper-proof educational certificates.

- **Key Features**:
    - Cryptographically secured credential creation
    - Institutional digital signatures
    - Revocation capabilities with audit trail
    - Customizable credential templates
    - Metadata enrichment for context
    - Batch issuance for program completion
    - Multi-language support
    - Expiration date management for time-bound credentials

### Skill Assessment Contract

Verifies specific skills and competencies through standardized or custom assessment frameworks.

- **Key Features**:
    - Granular skill taxonomy mapping
    - Performance-based assessment validation
    - Third-party assessment integration
    - Skill level gradation (beginner to expert)
    - Portfolio and project linking
    - Industry-standard alignment
    - Practical demonstration verification
    - Peer endorsement mechanisms

### Continuing Education Tracking Contract

Monitors and verifies ongoing professional development and lifelong learning.

- **Key Features**:
    - Continuing education unit (CEU) accumulation
    - Professional license renewal tracking
    - Recertification requirement management
    - Learning activity verification
    - Professional development planning
    - Industry compliance monitoring
    - Automatic notification for expiring credentials
    - Cross-organizational recognition

## Technical Architecture

The platform combines:
- Public blockchain for credential verification
- Decentralized storage (IPFS) for evidence and documentation
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- Self-sovereign identity standards (DID, Verifiable Credentials)
- Open badges compatibility
- API integrations with educational platforms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16.0+
- Ethereum development environment
- IPFS node connection
- DID implementation

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourinstitution/decentralized-credentials.git
   cd decentralized-credentials
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your specific configuration
   ```

4. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

## User Roles and Workflows

### For Educational Institutions
1. Register as a verified credential issuer
2. Create course and program templates
3. Define assessment criteria and completion requirements
4. Issue credentials to successful learners
5. Manage credential revocation and updates

### For Learners
1. Create self-sovereign educational wallet
2. Receive and store credentials from institutions
3. Share credentials selectively with employers or other institutions
4. Accumulate continuing education credits
5. Build comprehensive skill profile

### For Employers and Verifiers
1. Instantly verify credential authenticity
2. Assess candidate skills and qualifications
3. Verify continuing education compliance
4. Track employee professional development

## Privacy and Control Features

- Selective disclosure of credential details
